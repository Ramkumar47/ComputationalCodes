\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The laminar viscous supersonic flow over flat plate at zero degree angle-of-attack
    is numerically computed using Finite difference method and full
    Navier-Stokes equations. Maccormack's predictor-corrector method is used
    for solution in this work, and can be extended as the code is made in
    modular way. Computation code is developed using Fortran programming language
    and the post-processing is done using ParaView. The book by John D. Anderson
    , "Computational Fluid Dynamics - basics with applications" is used as the
    main reference for the work.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem description}
The following points describe the problem definition.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Freestream Mach number is taken as 4.0 and the other parameters,
        density, pressure and temperature were taken to be the values at
        standard sea level.
    \item Plate length is taken to be 1e-5 m. and the domain height is taken to
        be five times the boundary layer height at the end of the plate, which
        comes to be around 7.6e-6 m. The grid size of 100X100 is taken for
        the computation.
\end{itemize}
A schematic image taken from the book is shown in the \Cref{schematic_diagram}.

\section{Computation procedure}
\par The governing equations used in the work is given below.

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 0
\end{align*}

\begin{figure*}[!h]
   \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{supportingFiles/eqn_terms.png}
\end{figure*}

\par Apart from these, the additional equations used, that forms complete
Navier-Stokes equations are given below.
\begin{align*}
    \tau_{xy} &= \tau_{yx} = \mu \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \right) \\
    \tau_{xx} &= \lambda \left( \nabla . \vec{V}\right) + 2 \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\
    \tau_{yy} &= \lambda \left( \nabla . \vec{V}\right) + 2 \mu \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\
    q_x &= -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \\
    q_y &= -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \\
    p &= \rho R T \\
    e &= C_v T\\
    \mu &= \mu_0\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{3/2} \frac{T_0+110}{T+110} \\
    k &= \frac{\mu C_p}{Pr}
\end{align*}

\par The equation used in computing the timestep using Courant-Friedrich-Lewy
condition is given below. The following equation is used to compute timestep
size for all internal grid points and the timestep for computation is chosen to
be the lowest of all multiplied with Courant number $K = 0.6$.
\begin{align*}
    \left(\Delta t_{CFL}\right)_{i,j} &= \left[\frac{|u_{i,j}|}{\Delta x} + \frac{|v_{i,j}|}{\Delta y}+ \sqrt{\gamma R T_{i,j}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta y^2}} + 2\nu_{i,j} \left(\frac{1}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta y^2}\right)\right]^{-1} \\
    \Delta t &= K \times min\left(\Delta t_{CFL}\right)
\end{align*}

\par The algorithm followed for the computation is given below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The program is setup with required variables. The flow field variables
        such as temperature and pressure were initialized to free-stream values.
    \item The boundary conditions are applied, as indicated in the \Cref{schematic_diagram}.
    \item The conservative variables, U's, were computed from the primitive flow
        field variables. And the computation timestep is computed based on the
        flow field variables.
    \item The shear stresses and heat flux were computed using the derivatives
        of velocity that were computed from the current velocity fields.
    \item Then the conservative variables, E's and F's were computed from the
        primitive, shear stresses and heat flux variables.
    \item For the predictor step, the derivatives of E and F were computed using
        forward differencing and U derivatives were computed acoordingly.
    \item Then the predicted U values were computed and used to compute
        predicted primitive variables, then boundary conditions were applied
        and then the values were used to compute E's and Fs for the corrector
        step.
    \item The U derivatives of corrector step were computed from E and F derivatives
        and then the average of U derivatives from predictor and corrector steps
        were used to compute U values of next timestep.
    \item The primitive variables for next timestep is computed from the new
        U values and the boundary conditions were imposed, then the process
        is repeated from step 3 till convergence.
    \item Convergence is confirmed when the change in density values between
        each timestep is to be less than 1e-8.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Computation results}
\par The Fortran code is made in a modular way, such that any further modifications
and enhancements can be easily implemented. The converged solution is written
as a csv file from the Fortran code and the csv file is loaded into ParaView
for visualization. The contours obtained for the present case is shown in
\Cref{results_Tc}, this case is with constant wall temperature set to free-stream
temperature value.

\par Further, another case with adiabatic wall temperature was computed, those results are given in
\Cref{results_Wa}

    \caption{Computation results of case with adiabatic wall temperature}
    \label{results_Wa}
\end{figure}

\par And, another case with flow entering with an angle of -10 degrees with x-axis i.e.
flowing downwards with 10 degrees with the horizontal, is made by modifying
boundary conditions to simulate the supersonic flow over a wedge inclined at 10 degrees with
flow direction. The results obtained in this case is validated by comparing the
average downstream Mach number with the theorectical value. The results are
given in \Cref{results_os}.

\par Clear contours for all the cases were present with the code in the github
repository.

\section{Conclusion and Future works}
The laminar viscous supersonic flow over flat plate were numerically computed
using Finite difference method and full Navier-Stokes equations. The Fortran
code is made modular so that any further modifications and enhancements can be
implemented. The following enhancements are planned to make.
\begin{itemize}
    \item transforming 2D version of code to 3D.
    \item adding advanced solvers and turbulence models to the code.
    \item implementing grid transformations, so that curvilinear grids
        can also be solved using this code.
    \item solving capability with dynamic meshing.
\end{itemize}
