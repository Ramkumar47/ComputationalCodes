# Derivative computation validation
Here, the validation of derivative calculation that maps output to input, is
validated for the known fluid velocity decay ODE, using a pure data-driven model.

estimation.png graph shows the matching of estimated and exact velocity profiles
and their corresponding velocity derivative w.r.t. time is given in derivative.png
compared with the expected values.
