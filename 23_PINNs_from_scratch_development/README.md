# Building Physics Informed Neural Network from scratch
This work is about building PINN from scratch and understanding it from
the underlying mathematics and programming perspective. It was developed
using python programming language with numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries.

01_NN_from_scratch/ contains the codes of neural network developed from scratch
mapping parabola and velocity profiles

02_PINN_from_scratch/ contains the codes of PINN developed from scratch
mapping same parabola with equation and modelling Exponential velocity decay
of fluid due to viscosity.

03_documentation/ contains the latex documentation about the work
