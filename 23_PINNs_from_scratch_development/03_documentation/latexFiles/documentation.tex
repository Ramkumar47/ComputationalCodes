\begin{abstract}
	A physics-informed neural network (PINN in short) is an artificial neural
	network that learns the function from mathematical constraints that govern
	the underlying physics to be modelled. In this work, a PINN was built from
	scratch using Python programming language with fundamental libraries as
	numpy, pandas and matplotlib.  Aim of the present work is to get
	fundamental understanding on how a PINN works from the mathematical  and
	programming points of view.  Here, the classical fully connectected neural
	networks was constructed and tested by approximating a simple parabola plot
	data.  Further, the built network was developed to be physics-informed and
	validated by solving the ODE governing the exponential velocity decay of
	fluid due to viscosity. The understanding gained will be extended in
	further scientific computing using NNs.
