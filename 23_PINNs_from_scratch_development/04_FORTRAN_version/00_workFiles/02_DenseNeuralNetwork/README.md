# Dense Neural Network development code
Here the fortran code for the generalized fully connected dense network
was developed for custom use

As the validation, the absorbance spectrum approximation with noise
removal was performed with this code.

The approximation was performed with full stack, gradient descent algorithm
and the network was trained well within 2000 epochs
