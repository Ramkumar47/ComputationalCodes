This code solves the supersonic 2D flow field using Method of Characteristics.
This was developed as an assignment for the subject Compressible Flow in MTech 1st year

There are 2 methods for this
- point to point
- region to region

for now, point to point method was done, and as the next step, region to region method
will be made
