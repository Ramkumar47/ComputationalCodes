# Heat Conduction 2D computation using PINN
Here the 2D heat conduction equation is solved using PINNs

logs:
- the solution is done on a 140 grid points, but the results were great! that the
accuracy of extending the solution to 1 million grid was also good. The overall
time for the solution is around 3 minutes. whereas the equivalent one in the
FDM took nearly 30 mins. The solution from PINN can be used as initial condition
for FDM and the solution time can be greatly reduced.
