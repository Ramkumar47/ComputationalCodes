# PINN solution to 2D HC equation
Here, the solution of 2D HC is found in typical way, using quite number of
data points in the computation domain


logs:
- the solution looks good, but the model does not learn the boundary conditions
to the required accuracy. If it learns means, then the solution will be with
greater accuracy
