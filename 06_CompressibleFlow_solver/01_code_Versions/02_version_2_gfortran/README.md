# general 2d compressible flow solver
This is the modular code used to solve the supersonic flow over flat plate problem. These are the versions with enhancements made to the main
solver.

and following upgrades were made
- loops instead of matrix multiplications for enhanced speed
- resume simulation from previously computed solution fields
