# subsonic channel flow
in this case, Re = 100 is taken with Mach number as 0.1
The corresponding width of the channel is computed to be 4.3e-5 by taking
parameters in Reynolds number equation to be constant.
And since this is a subsonic flow, a constant pressure boundary at the exit
is maintained, and the pressure at inlet is allowed to float
