# subsonic boundary layer
in this case, Re = 1000 is taken with Mach number as 0.1
The corresponding length of the plate is computed to be 4e-4 by keeping other
parameters in Reynolds number equation to be constant.
And since this is a subsonic flow, a constant pressure boundary at the exit
is maintained, and the pressure at inlet is allowed to float
