# lid driven cavity flow
in this case, Re = 1000 is taken with Mach number as 0.1
The corresponding width of the channel is computed to be 4.3e-4 by taking
parameters in Reynolds number equation to be constant.
And since this is a subsonic closed domain flow, pressure is zerogradient
at all four sides, and temperature is fixed for all 4 sides.
top plate will move at M=0.1.
