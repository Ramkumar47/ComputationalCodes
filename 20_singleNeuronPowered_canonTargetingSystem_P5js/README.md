# single neuron powered cannon targetting system
Aim of the work is to create a cannon targeting model powered with single
neuron that controls the angle of hit. The target will be made to appear in
random location at program initiation and the model will make attempts to hit
the target while learning to adjust the hit angle.

The gradient based optimization was hard coded using automatic differentiation
for the angle adjustment.

output1.mp4 output2.mp4 are the two output videos showing the progress of
target attempts. The code was made in javascript using P5js.
