# Numerical solution of compressible couette flow
This solution is made by solving the nondimentional boundary layer equations obtained
from the full compressible form of NS equations. twin shooting method
was used to solve two coupled equations. The results were compared
with the analytical expression provided. This is done as an assignment for
the Boundary Layer Theory Course.
