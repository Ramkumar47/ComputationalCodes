# Numerical Solution of Falkner-Skan equation
This work contains the code development for the solution of falkner skan equations that solves the boundary layer flow over wedges at different angles.
This is solved using both FDM and shooting method. Further it contains the comparison of obtained solution with the
theoretical values obtained using Thwaits method. This is done as an assignment for the
Boundary Layer Theory course.
