# Piecewise local approximation function script
Here, the python script 'localApproximation.py' has the following
functions defined for local approximation

- "cubic_fit"
- "quadratic_fit"

both are piecewise approximation functions that are custom made for one
of the MTech project works. They use piecewise quadratic and cubic polynomials
with adjustable knot positions for better parameterization of the input data.

An example was included in this as a demo for the application. This example
problem is about the parameterization of Blasius solution profiles of the
laminar flow boundary layer.
