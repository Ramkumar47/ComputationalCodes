# inverse test of the approimated operator
Here, the inverse test for the operator was performed. the output
function is given as input to the operator in expecting back the input
function as output. i.e. in T: sin(t)->cos(t), when the operator
T is approximated, then it should handle T:cos(t)->sin(t) as well.

But it is not what happened, this confirms that the mathematical concept of
universal approximation theorem for operator. That is, the operator is
approximated with the input function itself encoded in it. Hence, it is
not a generalized operator that is been approximated
